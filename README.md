## My process

Looked at the reference picture provided and determined what elements were needed. I built out the HTML based on what elements I thought were in use such as a H1, footer, span, paragraphs, etc. Once the HTML was fully built out, I focused on going back through the HTML to determine if certain elements need classes and/or IDs. Afterwards, I turned my attention to the CSS portion. Although, I am not comformtable with positioning portion of CSS, I did a good job with the placement of the overall project based on the image provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- CSS Basics
- Usage of specificity
- CSS Selections

I particularly proud of the position of the image. It's simple, but was done without the usage of the MDN or any reference other than eyeing the picture given to us.

```css
.img {
  float: right;
  height: 285px;
  width: 210px;
  margin: 30px 60px 50px;
}
```

### Continued development

Things I will continue to focus on:

- CSS positions
- CSS flexbox
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Give explanations and examples. Great resource for all.
- [Class 04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Obtn29twk&list=PLBf-QcbaigsJysJ-KFZvLGJvvW-3sfk1S&index=5) - First class for CSS basics.
